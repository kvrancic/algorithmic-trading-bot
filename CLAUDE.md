# CLAUDE.md - Essential Memory

## Project: QuantumSentiment AI Trading System
**Budget**: â‚¬1,000 | **Mode**: Paper first, then live | **Broker**: Alpaca
MAIN RULE TO ALWAYS FOLLOW: NEVER SETTLE UNTIL EVERYTHING WORKS FLAWLESSLY. THIS NEEDS TO WORK IN REAL HIGH STAKES TRADING ENVIRONMENT. NO MINOR ISSUES. NO DEPENDENCY PROBLEM. EVERYTHING NEEDS TO WORK PERFECTLY. WHENEVER YOU SEE AN ERROR ADD IT TO YOUR CURRENT TODO.

## Architecture Evolution
1. **Phase 1-5**: Direct APIs â†’ ML â†’ Risk â†’ Execution
2. **Phase 6**: + LLM intelligence layer
3. **Phase 7**: MCP + LLM architecture

## Critical Safety
- Default: Paper trading only
- Live requires: CONFIRM_REAL_MONEY_TRADING=true
- Max: â‚¬50/position, â‚¬100/day loss, 20% drawdown

## Modularity Rules
- `src/` for core modules (data, models, risk, execution)
- Each component: single responsibility, clear interfaces
- No monolithic files - break into logical modules
- Type hints everywhere, comprehensive logging

## Key Reminders
- **Always** update TODO.md as you implement features and note changes in NOTES.md 
- **Always** reference README.md for complete requirements
- **Always** download packages with source .venv/bin/activate
- Start with direct APIs, add LLM layer later, then MCP
- Paper trading must work perfectly before live trading
- Risk management is more important than returns

## Dependencies
- **APIs**: alpaca-trade-api, praw, tweepy, alpha-vantage
- **ML**: torch, transformers, xgboost, scikit-learn  
- **Risk**: quantlib, scipy, pandas
- **Data**: postgresql, redis, sqlalchemy

## System Launch Checklist
- [ ] Check if the whole pipeline is working together correctly
- [ ] Draft detailed guide showing pipeline integration and module correlations
- [ ] Build extensive guide on system startup and usage
- [ ] Ensure system initializes and runs automatically
- [ ] Implement two trading modes:
  1. Full auto-trading
  2. Trade proposals for user approval
- [ ] Set up real-time trade monitoring and tracking
- **ðŸŽ¯ MILESTONE**: System capable of starting trading
