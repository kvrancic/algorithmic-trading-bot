**QuantumSentiment: Advanced AI Trading System for the €1,000 Experiment**

Transform your risk capital into a sophisticated quantitative trading laboratory. This system combines cutting-edge pattern recognition, market microstructure analysis, and social sentiment ML models to identify alpha in both crypto and equity markets. Built for those who view €1,000 as tuition for mastering algorithmic trading with institutional-grade techniques.

**Core Innovation:** Beyond basic indicators, QuantumSentiment employs computer vision for chart patterns, LSTM networks for price prediction, order book imbalance detection, and NLP transformers for sentiment analysis. It's like having a team of quant PhDs working 24/7 on your laptop.

**Tech Stack:** Pure Python quant stack with NumPy/Pandas/scikit-learn/PyTorch, MCP data feeds, vectorized backtesting engine, real-time event processing.
