# Trading Strategies Guide

## Overview

The QuantumSentiment Trading Bot employs a sophisticated multi-strategy approach that combines:
- AI-driven signal generation
- Sentiment analysis from social media and news
- Technical analysis
- Portfolio optimization
- Smart execution strategies

## Core Strategy Components

### 1. Signal Generation

#### Ensemble Model Predictions
The system uses four specialized models that work together:

**CNN Model (Pattern Recognition)**
- Identifies chart patterns and price formations
- Excels at detecting support/resistance levels
- Recognizes candlestick patterns

**LSTM Model (Sequential Analysis)**
- Captures temporal dependencies in price movements
- Predicts short-term price trajectories
- Analyzes momentum persistence

**XGBoost Model (Feature Importance)**
- Processes 200+ technical indicators
- Identifies key market drivers
- Provides feature importance rankings

**Transformer Model (Attention Mechanism)**
- Analyzes complex market relationships
- Captures long-range dependencies
- Processes sentiment context

#### Signal Criteria
A trade signal is generated when:
- Signal strength > 0.7 (scale: -1 to 1)
- Model confidence > 0.6 (scale: 0 to 1)
- Risk checks pass
- Sentiment alignment confirmed

### 2. Sentiment Integration

#### Reddit Sentiment Analysis
```python
Sources monitored:
- r/wallstreetbets (momentum plays)
- r/stocks (fundamental discussion)
- r/investing (long-term views)
- r/SecurityAnalysis (deep analysis)

Metrics tracked:
- Post volume and engagement
- Sentiment polarity (-1 to 1)
- Mention frequency
- Sentiment momentum
```

#### News Sentiment Analysis
```python
Sources analyzed:
- Financial news headlines
- Company press releases
- Analyst reports
- Economic indicators

Processing:
- Entity recognition
- Sentiment scoring
- Relevance weighting
- Temporal decay
```

### 3. Portfolio Construction

#### Regime-Aware Allocation
The system detects market regimes and adjusts strategies accordingly:

**Trending Market (Low Volatility)**
- Strategy: Black-Litterman optimization
- Focus: Momentum following
- Allocation: Concentrated positions
- Rebalancing: Less frequent

**Volatile Market (High Volatility)**
- Strategy: Risk Parity
- Focus: Risk distribution
- Allocation: Diversified positions
- Rebalancing: More frequent

**Stable Market (Mean-Reverting)**
- Strategy: Markowitz MVO
- Focus: Efficient frontier
- Allocation: Optimal risk/return
- Rebalancing: Periodic

#### Position Sizing
```python
Position size calculation:
1. Kelly Criterion for optimal sizing
2. Risk parity overlay
3. Concentration limits
4. Volatility adjustment

Formula:
position_size = min(
    kelly_fraction * capital,
    max_position_limit,
    risk_budget / position_volatility
)
```

### 4. Entry Strategies

#### Momentum Entry
- Triggered by: Strong directional signals
- Confirmation: Volume surge + sentiment alignment
- Entry: Market order or aggressive limit
- Size: Full position

#### Mean Reversion Entry
- Triggered by: Oversold/overbought conditions
- Confirmation: Sentiment divergence
- Entry: Scaled limit orders
- Size: Gradual accumulation

#### Breakout Entry
- Triggered by: Price breaking key levels
- Confirmation: Volume confirmation
- Entry: Stop-limit order
- Size: Partial position with adds

### 5. Exit Strategies

#### Take Profit Exits
```python
Dynamic targets based on:
- Volatility (ATR-based)
- Support/resistance levels
- Fibonacci extensions
- Risk/reward ratios

Example:
take_profit = entry_price + (atr * multiplier)
where multiplier = 2-4 based on market conditions
```

#### Stop Loss Management
```python
Types implemented:
1. Fixed Stop Loss
   - Percentage-based (default: 2%)
   - ATR-based (2x ATR)

2. Trailing Stop Loss
   - Percentage trailing (1-3%)
   - Volatility-adjusted
   - High-water mark based

3. Time-based Stop
   - Exit if no profit after N hours
   - Reduce position over time
```

#### Signal-based Exits
- Model reversal signal
- Sentiment shift detection
- Technical indicator divergence
- Risk limit breach

## Execution Strategies

### 1. TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
Best for: Large orders in liquid markets
```python
Implementation:
- Splits order into equal time slices
- Executes regularly over time horizon
- Minimizes timing risk
- Adapts to volatility
```

### 2. VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
Best for: Following market rhythm
```python
Implementation:
- Matches market volume profile
- Higher execution during high volume
- Reduces market impact
- Follows liquidity
```

### 3. Iceberg Orders
Best for: Large orders in thin markets
```python
Implementation:
- Shows only small portion
- Replenishes as filled
- Dynamic sizing based on book
- Minimizes information leakage
```

## Risk Management Integration

### Position-Level Risk
```python
For each position:
- Max loss per position: 1% of capital
- Position sizing: Kelly Criterion
- Correlation limits: Max 0.7 with existing
- Volatility scaling: Reduce size in high vol
```

### Portfolio-Level Risk
```python
Overall constraints:
- Max drawdown: 10%
- Daily loss limit: 3%
- Sector concentration: 30% max
- Total exposure: 100% (no leverage)
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Transaction Cost Minimization
- Smart routing to minimize fees
- Batch similar orders
- Use maker orders when possible
- Consider opportunity cost

### 2. Slippage Reduction
- ML-based slippage prediction
- Adaptive execution speed
- Order book analysis
- Liquidity seeking algorithms

### 3. Market Impact Mitigation
- Kyle's Lambda estimation
- Almgren-Chriss optimization
- Dark pool consideration
- Time-of-day optimization

- Economic data: Hedge or flatten before release
- Options expiry: Adjust for increased volatility

### 3. Regime Adaptation
- Bull market: Increase position sizes, wider stops
- Bear market: Reduce sizes, tighter stops, more shorts
- Sideways: Focus on mean reversion, range trading
